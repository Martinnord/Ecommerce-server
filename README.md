# Ecommerce Server

## Purpose

The purpose for this repo is to serve as a backend to the Ecommerce app that I'm building.

## Project goals

* Understand Prisma
* Understand GraphQL more

## Project planning

The methodology that will be used for this project is an agile-like one which is a mix of kanban/scrum.

### Backlog

The project planning consists of a backlog of all the features that are planned. Not all of the will become a reality because of time constraints but there will be a prioritization.
